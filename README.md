# Elevator saga Game JavaScript Repository

## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions for the Elevator Game. This was a fun project that I undertook to challenge my JavaScript skills. The game involves writing JavaScript code to control the elevators in a building, with the goal of efficiently transporting people to their desired floors.

## Game Levels

The code in this repository can complete levels 1-17 of the game. Some levels required slight modifications to the base code to account for the unique challenges they presented.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the game and navigate to the level you want to play.
3. Copy the corresponding code from this repository and paste it into the game's code editor.
4. Click 'Start' in the game to see the code in action!

## Modifications

While the base code can handle most levels, some required slight modifications. These modifications are documented in the comments of the code for each level.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository and make your own modifications. If you find a more efficient solution for any level, I'd love to see it!
